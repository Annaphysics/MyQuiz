Multiple choice quiz
In the present work an android application was developed which performs a multiple choice test. The following specifications were taken into account in the development of the application:

. The application requests and records the data of the examinee in a database. At the same time, a check is made in order to exclude the case of the same contestant being examined a second time.
. The test consists of a certain number of questions which are selected from a database, which is created through the application, at random. There is also the possibility for the developer to select the number of questions that will be displayed.
. The number of possible answers varies from question to question. Each question, however, will have only one correct answer.
.  Some of the questions include an image related to the query
. The test is performed in a limited time and at the end of the test the result is presented.
. The program saves and retrieves the name of the examinee, the time of the test, the result as well as the duration of the test.
. Audio messages in some functions during the test.
